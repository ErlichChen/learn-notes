# Fundamentals of Algorithm

## Scientific method

* Observe some feature of the natural world, generally with precise measurements.
* Hypothesize a model that is consistent with the observations.
* Predict events using the hypothesis.
* Verify the predictions by making further observations.
* Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.
