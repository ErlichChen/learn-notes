# The PRPL pattern

PRPL stands for:

* **Push** critical resources for the initial URL route.
* **Render** initial route.
* **Pre-cache** remaining routes.
* **Lazy-load** create remaining routes on demand.

PRPL strives to optimize for:

* Minimum time-to-interactive
* Maximum caching efficiency, especially over time as updates are released.
* Simplicity of development and deployment.
