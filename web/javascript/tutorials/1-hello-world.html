Best Practice: Where to include your tags
1. Fetch the HTML page.
2. Parse the HTML.
3. The parser encounters a <script> tag referencing an external script file.
4. The browser requests the script file. The parser blocks and stops parsing the other HTML on your page.
5. After some time the script is downloaded and subsequently exected.
6. The parser continues parsing the rest of the HTML document.

Antiquated recommenation

The old approach to solving this problem was to put <script> tags at the bottom of your <body>, because this ensures the parser isn't blocked until the very end.
This approach has its own problem: the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed.
For larger websites with large scripts & stylesheets, being able to download the script as soon as possible is very importand for performance.
If your website doesn't load within 2 seconds, people will go to another website.
In an optimal solution, the browser would start downloading your scripts as soon as possible, while at the same time parsing the rest of your document.

The modern approach

Browsers support the asyc and defer attributes on scripts. These attributes tell the browser it's safe to continue parsing while the scripts are being downloading.

async
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" async></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" async></script>
Scripts with the async attribute are executed asynchronously. This implies that it's possible to script 2 is downloaded & executed before script 1.

defer
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" defer></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" defer></script>
Scripts with the defer attribute are executed in order (i.e. first script 1, then script 2). This also does not block the browser.

Conclusion

The current state of the art is to put scripts in the <head> tag and use the async or defer attributes. The allows your scripts to be downloaded asap without blocking your browser.
